    "The question is to determine where in world will a new Air BnB user book their first travel.  The ability to predict when a new user will allow AirBnb to target users with better opportunities for finding a location.  Ultimately this should lead to a better user experience. \n",

    "**What data are you planning to use to answer that question?**\n",
    "I plan to use various user actions provided by the service provider that include the following: \n",
    "Countries\n",
    "Age\n",
    "Gender\n",
    "Website session activity\n",
    "Training set of users\n",

    "Even though this is a data set provided by Kaggle I noticed there are still a few different data items which may require a little clean so that it can be used for analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "** Why did you chose this topic?**\n",
    "I am a frequent traveler whom ironically has looked into using AirBnb many times but I could never find the type of place that I wanted with my travel dates.  I'm extremely curious of how I would have ranked if I were to do similar analysis.  In addition I have a project at work that will soon begin evaluating user actions for a large enterprise IT systems where they plan to track user actions with the intent of predicting when a user will conduct a search, read a document and produce a citation as a result.  \n"
